# Streaks app Data Analysis for a single goal

This project analyses data from the [Streaks app](https://streaksapp.com/), which I use to track good habits.

In this repository, you will find:
- the main Jupyter notebook file
- the CSV dataset

You can consult the Jupyter notebook file also in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aureliomerenda/streaks-app-data-analysis-for-a-single-goal).
